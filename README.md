## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

 Our main topic of interest would be to notice if there is some similarity between the reason for most of the crashes and try to identify a trend if there is any. Based on these reasons we could find out what are the flaws in the air safety system and what can be done to improve these so as to prevent these crashes from happening again. Another major topic of interest is which aircraft is the most involved in these accidents.Seeing the dataset, we can also find out what are the major sites of the crash so that the air-space regulations can be changed for future safer travel.  Our dataset covers vast details about these incidents and hence can help us focus on these topics easily. This dataset can also be used to create a nice and detailed data dashboard which will again highlight our major interests from this dataset. 





## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The given data was provided by the Data Society. This dataset displays aircraft accidents that took place between 2004 and 2009. The information is broken down into the following categories: date, time, location, operator, route, type of aircraft, registration number, passengers on board, casualties, ground fatalities, and an accident report/summary. We wanted to have as much latest information as we could get so that an accurate conclusion can be taken out of it. Therefore, we have taken the data for a span of 5 years from 2004 to 2009. The main purpose of the dataset is to find if there is a trend in all these air crashes that happened in 5 years. Secondly, we wanted to find the reason for the trend in the dataset. Lastly, we wanted to conclude our project on what safety measures can be formulated. The data has been collected by using the information provided by Data Society, it is an online platform using real-life datasets such as Air Traffic Passenger Data, Airplane crashes, and Airlines Delay. The information is human-collected data along with historical records keeping a track of all the past airplane crashes verified by news records and the information shared by the respective airlines.
