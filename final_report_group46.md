## &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<B>INTRODUCTION
### Our group decided that our project would be based on data analysis on air plane crashed that happened in the span of 5 years from <b>2004-2009</b>. When we came across this data, a series of questions started coming in our minds. Since, air travel in one of the most common and faster means of transport, we were intrigued on finding various trends and answers to our curiosity.<br><br>
## &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<B>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

## <B>QUESTIONS ANSWERED DURING ANALYSIS<br><br>

### I am interested in knowing the trends in air plane crashes and trying to find ways to ensure more safety and better air-travel expirence. In addition to this, I am also concerned how many lives were lost and how many survived these crashes? Secondly, the trends of plane crashes will let me analyze on what route did most crashes happened and what airline was responsible for the crashes.<br>
### There are some visualizations that I think would be helpful to understand my analysis. First of all I made a joint plot of <u>Fatalities during crash</u> and <u>People aboard durng crash</u>.

### This plot shows a diagnal straight line. The data points falling in this reigon are the ones where people aboard is equal to fatalities. This is not a positive obversation and tells us that the air travel system and technology was not perfect at that time.<br>
### Secondly, I made a small dataframe out of the dataset which includes <u>Airline</u> and <u>Fatalities during plane crash of that airline operator</u>.

### This is just a small segment but it clearly shows that the West Caribbean Airways is the operator with the largest toll number of <b>8160</b>. This number is humongous. This company started in December 1998 and the operations ceased in September 2005 due to serious financial and procedural problems.<br>
### For a more enhanced and deep understanding for my research question, I am adding a snapshot of my tableau.

### I am also adding a link to my python notebook where I did a detailed analysis and research.

### Some Insights that I was able to find out during this research was how data for aboard and fatalities went in hand-to-hand throughout the dataset with some outliers from the trend. Trimming down the dataset proved to be a good step as it helped me understand and focus me analyze on my reaearch analysis. Death of a single person is not acceptable.There can always be improvement is the avaition sector so that minimum lives are lost and the air transport can be made more safer in future times. I can say that lives lost cannot be brought back but as the technology is advancing day-by-day, air travel can be definitely made more safer in coming years.<br><br>
